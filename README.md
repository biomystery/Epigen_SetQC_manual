# ATAC-seq data report's user manual
@ UCSD Center for Epigenomics

The Center for Epigenomics at University of California San Diego
(UCSD) generates a data report upon completion of all ATAC-seq
projects. An example report can be found here. This tutorial explains
each section of the data report, and provides guidelines for the
interpretation of data quality metrics. 
 
The data report has 7 sections, listed in a legend on the left side of
each report. [Fig.0. Major sections in a typical report]: 

1. [Sample Information](01_sample.md)
2. [Sequencing metrics](02_sequencing.md)
3. [Alignment metrics](03_alignment.md)
4. [Signal-to-noise metrics](04_signal.md)
5. [Peak metrics](05_peak.md)
6. [Genome browser](06_browser.md)
7. [Download](07_download.md)
